  <b>Figured bass.<br></b>
  <ul>
<li>1. MuseScore's traditional, purposeful "figured bass" feature is ABYSMAL.  Don't even consider using it.  Here is a workaround.</li>
<li>2. Use the RNA feature, which is infinitely more robust, but don't enter any Roman numeralâ€”just plug in the figures directly.</li>
<li>3. Entering a number will enter a figure.  You can apply up to three.</li>
<li>4. Entering a line will allow you to show the motion of a single upper voice.</li>
<li>5. Stacking multiple analysis symbols will allow you to show oblique motion in a cleaner manner, but entering the figure again is faster and conveys the same information anyway.</li>
</ul>
