  <span class="content-text">Do:</span><br>

      <li>Write static alto and tenor parts - move by step or do not move.</li>
      <li>Keep the tenor part close to alto and far from bass.</li>
    </ul>
    <span class="content-text">Don't:</span><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Write large gaps between the soprano and alto parts.</li>
      <li>Write large gaps between the alto and tenor parts.</li>
      <li>Write overlap between voices - the order SATB should be kept from top to bottom.</li>
      <li>Jump an augmented interval in any part.</li>
      <li>Write parallel fifths or octaves between any two parts.</li>
    </ul>
    <span class="content-text-title">Chords</span>
    <ul>
      <li>In primary triads (<code>I, IV, V</code>):</li>
      <ul>
	<li>Always include the tonic and third of a chord.</li>
	<li>Try to double the tonic and have one 3rd and 5th - it is always acceptable to double the tonic.</li>
	<ul>
	  <li>Alternatively, doubling the 5th is possible.</li>
        </ul>
	<li>Doubling the 3rd is forbidden in major chords.</li>
	<li>Doubling the leading tone of a key is forbidden in any chord.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>In secondary chords:</li>
      <ul>
	<li><code>ii, ii&#176;</code></li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Use primarily in first inversion.  Root position is acceptable.</li>
	    <li><code>ii</code> - doubling the 3rd is allowed but not necessary.</li>
	    <li><code>ii&#176;</code> - diminished, the 3rd MUST be doubled.</li>
	  </ul>
	<li><code>iii</code></li>
          <ul>
	    <li>Use primarily in root position.  First inversion is acceptable.</li>
	    <li>Mediant chords must not be used in a minor key.</li>
	    <li>Use in the progression <code>I-III-IV-V</code>.</li>
	  </ul>
	<li><code>vi, &#x266D;VI</code></li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Use only in root position.</li>
	    <li>In a minor key, must double the 3rd of VI (tonic of the key).</li>
	  </ul>
	<li><code>vii&#176;, &#x266D;VII</code></li>
	  <ul>
            <li>Use only in first inversion.</li>
	    <li>Must double the 3rd regardless of key.</li>
	  </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <span class="content-text-title">Stylistic writing</span>
      <ul>
        <li>Aim for contrary motion against soprano at all times.</li>
	<li>Keep the rhythm incessantly driving forward - use 8th notes.</li>
	<li>The bass part should move a lot, preferably ascending towards the cadence.  Large jumps in the bass are acceptable.</li>
      </ul>
    <span class="content-text-title">Melodic embellishments</span>
    <div class="content-note">Note: fermata is used to signify the end of a phrase, which is a short 2-4 bar section of music.</div>
    <img src="bache.png" alt="Example" /><br>
    <span class="content-text">In the above example in D major, a <code>I-vi-I<sup>6</sup>-IV-V-I-I</code> progression is used by Bach.  There are several things to notice about this section of music.  Firstly, the V chord is, in fact, two separate chords.  This is beacuse it's written as a 4-3 suspension, with an added auxliary note.</span><br>
    <span class="content-text">There are 3 primary embellishments that were commonly used by Bach.</span><br>
    <ul>
    <li>Anticipation (ant)</li>
      <ul>
      <li>In an <i>anticipation</i>, the embellishing note is approached by step and doesn't move.</li>
      <li>The <i>anticipation</i> resolves once the harmony moves to a chord that contains the anticipated note.</li>
      <li>In essence, it is a note of the next chord, played before the harmony changes.</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Auxiliary note (aux)</li>
      <ul>
      <li>An auxiliary note is a type of embellishment which includes a note one step above or below the previous note.</li>
      <li>The auxiliary note conflicts with the chord, causing a dissonance that must resolve.</li>
      <li>The auxiliary note resolves into the same chord tone.  This may or may not be a different chord.</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Suspension (sus)</li>
      <ul>
      <li>A suspension occurs when a note from a chord is held while the harmony shifts, before resolving.</li>
      <li>The suspension is doubtless the most important kind of embellishment, being use very commonly.</li>
      <li>Suspensions must resolve downwards (4-3, 7-6, 9-8).</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <span class="content-text-title">Modulation</span><br><br>
    <span class="content-text">In any standard key, there are 5 possible destination keys for modulation.</span><br>
