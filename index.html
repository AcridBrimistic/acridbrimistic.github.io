<h1>30.3.17</h1>
<h4>I'd rather not share personal information like everyone else seems to be doing for whatever reason. I really do not understand. It seems there vulnerabilities about these platforms (educationally based hosts seem to be the biggest offender of this, see infosec docs)</h4>
<br>
 <h4>There will always be a few followers of these ways, although I myself think this is foolish and I am fully againist it.</h4>
  <br>
<h4>You can contact me on IRC at AcridBrimistic. Please do not post personal threats or attacks, they will not be tolerated. Make sure to use an encrypted channel.</h4>
  <br>
<h4>So, today was a very uninteresting day, nothing much happened, and I just sat there, procrastinating, browsing Reddit or whatever</h4>
  <br>
<h4>Eventually I go play some Dwarf Fortress, and call it a day.</h4>
  <br>
  <h1>31.3.17</h1>
  <br>
<h4>Almost the end of the month, and I have no stories to tell. I've been working on a few projects, like the rectangle game, but then I quit.</h4>
  <br>
<h4>I loaded up a few classic kaizo romhacks, tried to play them, ended up failing miserably on the 1-frame TAS jumps, as expected.</h4>
  <br>
<h4>At this point i'm not entirely sure, I went to browse Reddit once again, watched an episode of Westwing and eventually fell asleep.</h4>
  <br>
<h1>1.4.17</h1>
<br>
<h4>And it's april fools. I had nothing planned, so I just sat at home doing nothing. It was actually saturday so it's not like it mattered anyway</h4>
<br>
<h4>So, I went to /r/place to see if dwarf fortress and /r/armok had won, unfortunately, not even close. In fact, Brazil won over the mechanic. Then the void came, but luckily /r/pathofexile was the only victim.</h4>
<br>
<h4>I decided to work on the whole console project I had years ago. Then I remembered how cross-compilers didn't work, so I just had to use an existing raspbian distro.</h4>
<br>
<h4>I go to SMWCentral, load up a few romhacks, found Super Mario Logic from 2013, which was a pretty good puzzle hack back then. </h4>
<br>
<h4>Feeling burnt out, I load up megazeux to see my old games. Nothing particular, I did have a memory cell setup but I never uploaded stuff to DigitalMZX to it didn't matter.>
