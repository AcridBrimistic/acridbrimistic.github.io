            <h1>DF Adventure Mode: Ultimate Guide</h1>

            <h2>Tutorial to DF adventure mode</h2>


            <h2>Alright, so, Reddit has gone insane over adventure mode shit,<br> so I might as well make a guide of my own</h2>
            <h2>This all comes from personal experience, and testing things both live in adventure mode and in the object testing arena</h2>

            <h1>Myths:</h1>
            <h2>First, I'd like to clear out some confusing myths about combat in adventure mode.</h2>
            <h2>1: Leaves wreck bogeymen?</h2>
            <h3>I would say this is incorrect. Trying to fight bogeymen with leaves is unfortunately not as effective as people make it out to be.</h3>
            <h3>This game simulates "misc. objects" as boxes, which mean while a leaf hit a lot, it won't hit hard with the physics in this game.</h3>
            <h3>They are, however surprisingly strong, with a decent Fighter and Misc. Object User skill.</h3>

            <h2>2: Throwing is op</h2>
            <h3>Yeah, sorta. Throwing rocks and coins can "chip bones" and deal other types of bone wounds.</br></h3>
            <h3>Bone damage in this game causes huge amounts of pain, and anything without [NOPAIN] will likely give in after throwing enough</h3>
            <h2>3: Necromancer is op</h2>
            <h3>Yep, 100%. The fixed stat is bugged and you can still increase attributes, and althrough minions don't seem strong, the overwhelming amout of them can kill things easily.</h3>
            <h3>Just watch out for AoE attacks, as raised bodyparts tend to cluster together and get all killed</h3>
            <h2>4: Spider/Elephant men are op</h2>
            <h3>Spider men are kind of totally op, because they can wield a million shield and be invincible. However, Elephant men are op againist a lot of things with no armor, if you have a good Fighter/Striker/Kicker/Observer skill, you can really destroy almost anything.</h3>
